# *My College Experience*

Originally, I wanted to attend the University of Alabama - Tuscaloosa, which I got accepted into. However, my dad forced me to take a tour Mizzou, in which I fell in love with the atmosphere.

#### Classes & Schoolwork
Sometimes schoolwork can be overwhelming for me, especially this class. Coming to Mizzou with a year's worth of college credits from AP cources and dual enrollment has really been my savior. Each semester, I have been able to take around fifteen credit hours (which isn't too terrible) and still graduate within three years instead of four. 

With COVID, classes have been more difficult to say the least. Being in STEM, since my major is Economics, a lot of difficult concepts pop up in my major classes. This semester, both of my major core classes are completely online with no scheduled meeting time. I'm a person who likes to ask questions because I usually don't understand everything fully. In total I have only had five in-person classes split between three semesters of classes. A lot of kids tend to like online school, but I do not. Based on my experiences here at Mizzou, in-person classes have been much easier to the grade in, especially due to the fact you can connect with your professors.

#### Social Life
My first year on campus I honestly had no social life. With COVID and some personal issues I was having, it made it super difficult to go out and meet people. Without friends, it is kind of hard to have a really good social life. Second semester things started to get a little better for me, but not the greatest, still due to COVID. However, I did make some friends that ended up being good ones. Through some friends I had from home and my roommates, I was able to get out and connect with new people. By the end of the year last year, I felt like I my social life was improved.

By the start of the school year this year, most of the friendships I made last year still existed. Usually I hangout with Bethany, mentioned on my friends page of this website, once a day. Even though COVID still exists, many more things are available to do now. We can go out to have a good time on the weekends and meet new people. Although there is a lot of negative things happening in the Greek life community which limits things to do, I don't feel like I'm missing out on the college experience everyone wants.

#### Campus
The campus here at Mizzou is so pretty. Sometimes walking across campus can be a pain because it is so spread out, but campus is beautiful in every season. I also feel like you get your exercise in for the day. When I lived in the Southwest Village dorms, my classes were so far away, but I got to get out and move my legs for a bit everyday or so. 

The one complaint I do have about the Mizzou campus is how awful it can be walking during our intense winter weeks. I recall last year it was sleeting, freezing rain and I had a class on the north side of campus. My eyelashes had froze in the wind and by the time I got to sit down in class I could barely feel my toes.

# *Work*
This year, I was able to get a job working for the University of Missouri on Event Staff. As an Event Staff worker, I get to choose my schedule and experience sports events (and other campus events) while getting paid!

**A list of events we can work include:**
1. SEC Football Games
2. Concerts on Campus (sometimes off campus)
3. Softball Games
4. Basketball Games

Although I have only worked a Chris Stapleton concert and SEC Football Saturdays, I've had a ton of fun. Gamedays with your friends can be fun, but when the game isn't predicted to be a *good* one, why not work it and make money? 

I also really enjoy working because of my friends that work with me sometimes. Bethany (mentioned on the friends page), is applying to for a job on Event Staff which is exciting! I met one of my co-workers, Garrett, and really enjoy working with him. At the Chris Stapleton concert, we both were working and got to watch the show while getting paid!

# *My Friends*

Although I do not have very many friends, I have awesome friends. Some of my closest friends I have met at college, while I have stuck with a couple for many, many years that I met in my hometown. 

#### Abi
Going on a decade of friendship, Abi and I are still extremely close despite going to different colleges. I obviously go to Mizzou while she chose stay closer to home and go to Illinois State (ISU). Usually when I go home, I will stop by ISU to see her for lunch or dinner and spend some time together.

When we were younger, we loved to jump on her trampoline with her neighbors who have also remained pretty good friends of mine. I used to ride my bike to her house everyday during the summer in the 4th/5th grade. As we got older, we started to enjoy going to parties together and exploring our world. During the summer of 2019, we went to Florida, South Carolina, and Alabama together. We have many trips for the future in mind.

#### Bethany
Although we have not known eachother for more than a year, Bethany is probably my closest friend here at college. We met at the end of last year at a party and have been almost inseparable ever since. 

This year, we live in the same apartment complex, but not in the same unit. This is probably for the better. Bethany and I love going out together on the weekends and Fridays with some of our other friends. Some of my favorite memories at college have been with Bethany. Our favorite place to go is Shiloh's for toasted ravioli.

#### Noah
Similar to Abi, Noah and I have been friends for almost a decade, if not longer. Our grandmas are best friends. They have known eachother for quite sometime, same goes for our mothers. 

It wasn't until fourth grade that I remember knowing Noah, but ever since then we have been close friends through grade, middle, and high school. Noah doesn't attend college so when I go home I will spend a decent amount of time with him. We used to go to Starbucks and work on homework, study for finals, and talk. After that we would go on drives and listen to music, sometimes with another one of my close friends.
